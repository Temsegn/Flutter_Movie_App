  - Movie description
  - Release date
  - Genre
  - Rating
  - Cast and crew information
- **Dark/Light Mode**: The app supports both dark and light themes. Users can toggle between the two for a personalized experience.

## File Structure


## How It Works

### Movie Grid View

The app fetches a list of movies using an API (e.g., TMDB API) and displays them in a grid view. Each movie is displayed with a poster image, title, and release date.

### Search Functionality

A search bar at the top of the grid view allows users to search for movies. The app will filter the movies based on the search query and update the grid view with matching results.

### Movie Detail Page

When a user clicks on a movie, they are redirected to the detail page where more detailed information about the movie is shown, including:

- Description
- Release date
- Genre
- Rating
- Cast

At the bottom of the page, related movies are shown based on the genre and theme of the selected movie.

### Dark/Light Mode

The app supports both dark and light modes, which can be toggled through the settings or a button in the app bar.

### Favorites

Users can mark movies as their favorites. These favorites are saved locally in Hive, and users can view them on a separate screen dedicated to favorites.

### Related Movies

On the movie detail page, related movies are fetched from the API based on the genre or actors in the movie, and displayed in a horizontal scrollable list.

## Usage

- Tap a movie in the grid view to view its details.
- Use the search bar to find specific movies.
- Toggle between dark and light modes by changing the settings.
- Mark movies as favorites by clicking the heart icon, and they will be saved in your favorites list.
- View related movies on the detail page.
